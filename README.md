To be able to come together to make you realise your potential and what heights you may go have always been our sole mission. We know that everyone has this never ending energy in themselves to do the best of everything but there is a need to channelize it.

There is no match of a person who knows his strength and then performs to its maximum level. TechWalt is an organization which help beginners to get familiar with open source and helps them to get started with their first contribution in open source.

Core Beliefs we abide by :
*	To create an online environment comfortable enough for everyone to work.
*	To create a safe online space for learning, discussing and socializing.
*	Laying emphasis on sharing ideas irrespective of where one belongs from.
*	Creating a space solely for revolutionizing the way of coding. 
*	A platform for endless learning and where everyone can contribute.
